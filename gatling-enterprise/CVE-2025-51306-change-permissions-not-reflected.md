# Description 

On Gatling Enterprise versions below 1.25.0, When the permissions of the user are changed, the new permissions are not applied until the user generates a new "session-id" by logging-in back on the system.  
More importantly, a removed user with a valid "session-id" can still access the application as if it was existing.  
In top of that, since the sessions are not expiring ([broken logout](https://github.com/Flo354/vulnerabilities/blob/main/gatling-enterprise/CVE-2025-51306-broken-logout.md)), removed users can use the app indefinitely, as-long-as they keep the session-id.

The following CVE was assigned: CVE-2025-51306

# Remediation

It is recommended to verify at each request that the user still exists and still has the permission to perform the action.
