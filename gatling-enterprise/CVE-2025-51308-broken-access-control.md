On Gatling Enterprise versions below 1.25.0, at least two read endpoints reserved for "admins" are targetable by users having only the "view" role
- /api/private/teams
- /api/private/repositories

For non-privileged users, the endpoint that is accessible should only be:
- /api/private/roles/teams, which gives only the "id" and "name" of the team required for the page "Simulations"

The following CVE was assigned: CVE-2025-51308
